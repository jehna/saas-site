            <h2>Your product's first awesome benefit</h2>
            <p>
                Remember that users don't usually want the drill; they only want
                the hole in the wall. That's why you should focus solely on the
                benefits of your product. You can try it like this
            </p>
            <pre>echo "No features, just benefits" | cowsay</pre>
            <p>
                This demonstrates that even a simple ASCII cow knows that you
                should focus on your product's benefits rather than features.

            <h2>Some testimonials of your product</h2>
            <p>
                You know, people tend to trust testimonials a lot. Like:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                This product rocks!
                <small> - Some homeless dude I gave 50 bucks for saying this</small>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This demonstrates that even a simple ASCII cow knows that you
                should focus on your product's benefits rather than features.
